## Don’t Make Users Think: Implementing Design Thinking with SLDS

*SalesforceSummaries is a publication that delivers the **key** insights from Salesforce YouTube videos. We aim to be the [getAbstract.com](https://www.getabstract.com/en/) of Salesforce tutorial videos. These publications will save you time as you keep up to date with the latest technological changes within the Salesforce ecosystem.*

**Introduction:** The Salesforce Lightning Design System (SLDS) has been designed with UX in mind. A simple and intuitive UI results in a much better UX.

**Details**: ‘[Don’t Make Users Think: Implementing Design Thinking with SLDS](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zvy2KapquWQ&list=PLGV7L70m1lOudWgV5o7GpaIdDryw354Es)’

**Presenter**: Gaurav Kheterpal

**Time:** 19 minutes

**Key Terms**: SLDS, Visualforce, Design Thinking

 1.@1.00 — In this presentation, Design Thinking and SLDS will both be discussed. You will learn how SLDS can be compliant with Design Thinking to improve the user experience (UX).

2.@1.30 — There is a stark difference in terms of the mentality of developers and designers. A good UX will have the input of complimenting design and development.

3.@3.05 — Design is an art that people use.

4.@3.15 — Another very famous quote about design is:

5.@3.35 — But probably the best quote about design is from Steve Jobs:

6.@4.40 — You need to think from the perspective of a user on what is the most simple and best UI.

7.@5.10 — The below is an example of a very bad design. It’s confusing and not simple.

8.@5.20 — Below is another example of bad design. It’s a form that is very complicated with far too many questions that are not displayed in a helpful way.

9.@5.55 — A good example of design thinking is below. It can be as simple as creating a button for the action. This is much clearer for the user.

10.@6.30 — Another example of bad design is to use a ‘positive’ colour for a ‘negative’ message:

11.@7.50 — The SLDS allows developers to focus on the application logic while designers can focus on the UX.

12.@8.15 — SLDS is a component driven model. **Components** are the building blocks of Salesforce applications, enabling designers and developers with ready-to-go interface elements available in HTML and CSS code.

Furthermore, there are **utility classes** in SLDS which allow developers to apply a single rule or simple pattern to your components. This adheres to the single responsibility principle in software engineering.

In addition, [**design tokens](https://www.lightningdesignsystem.com/design-tokens/)** store visual design attributes and are used in place of hard-coded values (like hex values for colour). This enables you to customize your apps to suit your brand.

SLDS has a huge [**icon library](https://www.lightningdesignsystem.com/icons/)**. This can be leveraged to help your customers clearly navigate the apps you create.

Motion and animation is also supported in SLDS.

13.@10.45 — SLDS is a responsive framework and so creates a very consistent brand across all types of devices.

14.@11.05 — When the Salesforce team started working on the SLDS, one of their main aims was to improve the performance and underlying issues of Visualforce.

15.@11.30 — A very popular maxim in software engineering is ‘if it isn’t broken, don’t fix it’. So why create SLDS in the first place, instead of just relying on standard page layouts and Visualforce? The Salesforce team wanted a more intuitive and appealing UI and UX.

The Salesforce team wanted greater design thinking in the application. The four principles that are the cornerstone are clarity, efficiency, consistency and beauty.

16.@13.10 — There are a number of tools that come with SLDS, which enables developers to more easily style applications. One of these is the [CSS Customizer](https://tools.lightningdesignsystem.com/css-customizer).

17. @15.00 — Visualforce is not responsive by default. One can use a responsive framework within Visualforce though, such as Bootstrap. However, SLDS has been designed to be responsive without the need for any additional framework.

18. @15.30 — The following Trailhead badges are excellent resources for learning more about SLDS.

19. @16.45 — Finally, the Lightning Design System documentation can be found [here](https://www.lightningdesignsystem.com/). It is incredibly comprehensive, with sample code and implementation notes.
