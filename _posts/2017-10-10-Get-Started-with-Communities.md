## Hands-on Training: Get Started with Communities

*SalesforceSummaries is a publication that delivers the **key** insights from Salesforce YouTube videos. We aim to be the [getAbstract.com](https://www.getabstract.com/en/) of Salesforce tutorial videos. These publications will save you time as you keep up to date with the latest technological changes within the Salesforce ecosystem.*

**Introduction:**

Although this is a relatively old tutorial video (Nov 2013), there is a comprehensive amount of hands-on training for the [Community cloud](https://www.salesforce.com/uk/products/community-cloud/overview/) and a lot of knowledge transferred to viewers. This tutorial video does a deep dive into how one can leverage Communities to engage with customers and partners easily, quickly and effectively.

Key points: Salesforce Communities facilitate collaboration and communication and ultimately, drive sales.

 1. @1.00 — Communities are branded online spaces in which employees, customers and partners can engage with other another. Communities are an online platform which you can use to facilitate collaboration and communication with employees, partners and customers. You can think of these online communities as a way to channel all of the great knowledge that your customers and employees have to work together

2. @1.50 — Communities is another avenue to provide customers with. For example, customers generally prefer self-service instead of logging cases with Support and Communities can help to facilitate this.

3. @3.05 — Communities can be completely branded however you like.

4. @3.20 — Customer needs are changing and they are changing fast. Customers want to work with their vendors.

5. @3.50 — Communities live inside your Salesforce org and allow you to give external members access to subsets of your data. Access is controlled through community profiles and roles that integrate with your security model.

6. @3.55 — Each community member is a contact and you enable one to be a community member from the contact. With that, they become a user and with that, they have a Profile. The record access is governed in part from the Profile.

7. @5.50 — There are different types of Community licenses available to you and with different costs. You should work with your Salesforce account manager on this as there are many options and they can get quite complicated. For example, you may have a ‘*X number of logins per month*’ option for X number of community users. Or, you may instead go for an ‘*unlimited number of logins per month for X number of community users*’.

8. @6.05 — You will also want to register a domain name. This is important because once you establish your domain in the community, you cannot change it. Most of the time, it will just be your company name.

9. @6.45 — Once you enable a Community, the global header will appear which acts as a toggle between your Salesforce instance and the Salesforce community. This saves time between toggling between the two. You may want to consider to whom this permission should be enabled for as you may not want all your internal employees to see this feature.

10. @7.15 — Once you create a Community, it will be in Preview mode by default. It won’t be published until you are ready to select ‘Publish’, at which point users may receive a ‘Welcome Email’ if that setting has been selected.

11. @7.20 — You will get a Community Member profile. You can think about how you want to utilize that Profile and if you need to setup any additional permission sets.

12. @7.25 — In terms of enabling users to login to the community, you can choose to enable self registration, self authentication or username and password login options.

13. @8.15 — It is best practice to have an internal pilot group.

14. @8.40 — You’ll want to make sure that all your branding assets are uploaded to Salesforce. You’ll also want nice email templates. You may also want to create a zone; which uses Chatter Answers, Answers and Ideas. This can be considered as a subset of a Community with a particular focus on a product or topic.

15. @10.00 — The hands on exercise is:

16. @34.40 — External members are going to be enabled from their contact record and from this, they will have a user record with a Profile. This determines what tabs and features are accessible in the community. If it’s a Partner community, you’ll need to enable the account as a partner account, and enable the contacts underneath that account. Partners have Partner Roles.

17. @35.00 — [Community User Visibility](https://help.salesforce.com/articleView?id=networks_user_sharing.htm&type=0) will allow community users to see other community user records.

18. @49.00 — You can add custom objects as tabs in the Communities you want.

19. @49.15 — The social collaboration and unique branding is for Communities whereas this wasn’t possible with Portal. Portal has effectively been superseded by Communities.
